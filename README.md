# File_magement
This repository contains a Python script for a simple file management tool with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using Tkinter. The tool allows users to select a source folder and a destination folder, and move files from the source folder to the destination folder based on specified file numbers.


Features:

GUI Interface: The program provides a user-friendly GUI interface for selecting source and destination folders.
File Movement: Users can input file numbers (comma-separated) into the GUI, and the program will move files with matching names from the source folder to the destination folder.
Error Handling: The program handles file not found errors gracefully and continues moving other files.
Usage:

Clone the repository to your local machine using git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git.
Install Python if not already installed.
Navigate to the repository directory.
Run the Python script file_move_program.py.
Use the GUI to select source and destination folders and input file numbers to move files accordingly.
